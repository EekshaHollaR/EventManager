AI Conversation Log 

AI Assistant Used: ChatGPT, Claude (Anthropic)


I used LLMs to accelerate design and scaffolding for the Campus Event Reporting prototype. Below are the recorded sessions, with prompts, full AI output, and a short note about what I accepted vs changed. I have ensured the README and Design Document are my own words.

## How to read this folder
1. Open `Brainstroming.md` — which consists of the brainstorming.
2. Open `Db-Schema.md` — schema the AI suggested and the modifications I did.


## Session index
1. **Brainstroming.md** — Brainstorm: features, edge cases, multi-tenancy decision. (Accepted architecture; changed single DB reasoning)
2. **Db-Schema.md** — CREATE TABLE SQL. (Accepted; added manager_id and unique constraints)
<!-- 3. **03_api_design_claude.md** — API endpoints & request/response examples. (Used as base; rewrote some error codes)
4. **04_fastapi_skeleton_cursor.md** — Starter FastAPI app generated by Cursor. (Copied into `prototype/main.py`, modified for persistence)
5. **05_sql_queries_chatgpt.md** — Analytic SQL queries used to generate `/reports/*.csv`.
6. **06_code_review_chatgpt.md** — AI code review; applied transaction handling and input validation suggestions. -->

## Tools used
- ChatGPT (web) — multiple sessions
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet — API & schema refinement
- Cursor (IDE) — code skeleton generation

## Notes on acceptance/modification
For each AI output I have added a short note  describing exactly:
- “what I accepted as-is”
- “what I modified and why”
- “what I rejected and why”
